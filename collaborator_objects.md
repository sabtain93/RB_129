# Collaborator Objects

Objects that are stored as a state of another object are known as collaborator obejcts. Collaborator objects are mostly custom objects and not the objects from RUby core library.

Collaboration is a relationship of association not inheritance. Collaboration is a 'has-a' relationship.

A collaborator object is an object that is stored as state within another object. As state is tracked by instance variables, this means that objects that are assigned to instance variables of an
other object are known as collaborator objects. 

Collaboration is a way of modeling relationships between object types that have an associative relationship. That is, objects that work togather with each other. Collaborator objects can be thought of as having a 'has a' relationship. For example, a library has books, a team has members, a deck has cards etc.

Collaborator objects are an important aspect of OO design as they represent the connections between the various buidling blocks of the program. Collaborator objects allow us to breakdown the problem into smaller pieces and work on the smaller pieces seperately. This makes solving the smaller problem easier. And then bringing togather all the pieces or buidling blocks that fit togather to solve the problem at hand.
